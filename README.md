# RPiTripwire

## Explained:
This project's aim was to create a Raspberry-Pi based security/slert system similar to that of the Ring doorbell. The code simply waits for detected movement from 2 HC-SR501 PIR Motion Sensor modules. Once detected, an image is captured using the Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2. Then, a text message is sent to the user's phone alongside the captured image. The service used to send the messages from the RPi is Twilio.
